# Astronomy-Calculator

I am attempting to gain some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project I am creating will allow a user to determine the solution to several different calculations related to astronomy. For example, if a user wants to know how long it would take (in years) to travel to another star system. The user would determine the type of units he or she is using, the average speed of the spacecraft (MPH or KmPh), and the distance from Earth to the desired star system (in lightyears). Once the information is entered, the user will receive the result. I am looking to add addition calculations similar to this, along with other basic conversions (Miles to Lightyear). As of right now I am looking for some guidance to how I should continue with this application, I was not sure if I should have all calculations on one JS file or if I should have one JS file per calculation. Any input or guidance would be greatly appreciated.
